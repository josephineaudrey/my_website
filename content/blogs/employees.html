<h1>IBM HR Analytics: Employee satisfaction and income</h1>
<p>During my internship at an HR Tech start-up Leapsome (leapsome.com) I learned a lot about the importance of employee retention and employee satisfaction. Employee engagement and meaningful feedback, for example, are two drivers of productive employees. This data set on past and current employees at a company can give insights about what can contribute to workforce attrition. After cleaning the data set with data about around 1500 employees, I will analyze several HR data and different relationships within.</p>
<p><em>Note: Scroll over the interactive graphs to see the exact amount of servings</em></p>

<p>The attrition rate is 16.1%.</p>

The monthly income increases with additional levels of education, which is intuitive. Interestingly, the median income is higher for employees with a College degree than for those with a Bachelor degree. The mean, however, is higher for the Bachelor degree. This might imply that a Bachelor is not worth much more than a College degree when it comes to monthly income.</p>
<p>When comparing income between gender, the female mean and median income is higher than the male ones. This can, however, be influenced by various factors, such as the job position and education levle.</p>

<h3>Job role and income</h3>

Managers have the highest income followed by research directors and then after a gap, healthcare representatives, manufacturing directors and sales executives. Sales representatives earn the least, however, they have a lot of outliers for this and other “low-paying” roles.</p>

In conclusion, it seems that higher incomes relates to higer job satisfaction. The direction of causation is difficult to establish in this case. Employees might be more satisfied because they earn more. An alternative explanation is that those who are satisfied with their job also do a better job and, thus, earn more since they are being more productive.</p>
