# Challenge: GDP components over time and among countries

After cleaning the dataset, I will try to reproduce a given graph with a different theme and then analyze the different GDP components across countries 
```{r read_GDP_data, include=FALSE}
UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(("Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip
```

```{r reshape_GDP_data}
# tidy data and convert to long format
tidy_GDP_data <- UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('1970':'2017'), 
               names_to = "Year", 
               values_to = "Amount") %>%
  rename(Components = IndicatorName) %>%
  # Components [Components == "Exports of goods and services"] <- "Exports"
  # rename indicators
  mutate(Components = case_when( 
  Components == "Final consumption expenditure" ~ "Final consumption",
  Components == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household expenditure",
  Components == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government expenditure",
  Components == "Gross capital formation" ~ "Gross capital formation",
  Components == "Gross fixed capital formation (including Acquisitions less disposals of valuables)" ~ "Gross fixed capital",
  Components == "Changes in inventories" ~ "Inventory change",
  Components == "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports",
  Components == "Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports",
  Components == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" ~ "GDP",
  Components == "Agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing (ISIC A-B)" ~ "ISIC A-B",
  Components == "Mining, Manufacturing, Utilities (ISIC C-E)" ~ "ISIC C-E",
  Components == "Manufacturing (ISIC D)" ~ "ISIC D",
  Components == "Construction (ISIC F)" ~ "ISIC F",
  Components == "Wholesale, retail trade, restaurants and hotels (ISIC G-H)" ~ "ISIC G-H",
  Components == "Transport, storage and communication (ISIC I)" ~ "ISIC I",
  Components == "Other Activities (ISIC J-P)" ~ "ISIC J-P",
  Components == "Total Value Added" ~ "TVA")) %>%
  mutate(Amount = (Amount / 1e9)) # divide to express data in billions
glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(("gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r create graph}
# define 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")

# define 5 components
indicator_list <- c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports")
tidy_GDP_data_filter <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
    filter(Country %in% country_list, Components %in% indicator_list) 

# factor components
tidy_GDP_data_filter$Components <- factor(tidy_GDP_data_filter$Components, levels = indicator_list)
countries_3 <- tidy_GDP_data_filter  %>%
  
  # filter(Country %in% country_list, Components %in% indicator_list) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Amount, color = Components)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Components)) +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       y = "Billion US$", 
       x = "") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend("Components of GDP")) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1970, 2017, by = 10)) + # scale by 10 years
  expand_limits(y = 0) +
  NULL
  
countries_3        
```

```{r calc GDP}
wide_GDP_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Components", values_from = "Amount") %>%
  select(Country, Year, "Household expenditure":"GDP")
wide_GDP_data
wide_GDP_calc <- wide_GDP_data %>%
   mutate(`Net Exports` = Exports - Imports) %>% 
   # GDP = C + I + G + Nx
   mutate(GDP_calc = (`Household expenditure` + `Gross capital formation` + `Government expenditure` + `Net Exports`))
 
wide_GDP_calc
```

We can see that for every observation there can be small deviations between the calculated and the given GDP ranging up to 6%.

```{r difference GDP}
# calculate % difference between GDP given and GDP calculated
wide_GDP_calc_diff <- wide_GDP_calc %>%
  mutate(GDP_diff = abs((GDP - GDP_calc)/GDP))
         
wide_GDP_calc_diff 
difference_plot <- wide_GDP_calc_diff %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=GDP_diff)) +
  geom_histogram()

# show the distribution of differences
difference_plot
sum(wide_GDP_calc_diff$GDP_diff, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(("gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```


Looking at this chart, I will try to analyze the different dynamics among these three countries? 
First of all, the graph shows the proportion of GDP components in Germany, India, and the US.

In Germany, these proportions have stayed relatively constant over the years. As in the other two countries, Household Expenditure represents the largest proportion of GDP at around 60%. Net Exports have remained around 0%, meaning that Exports were almost equal to Imports. However, since the 2000s Exports have increased, leading to a trade surplus. This could possibly be related to the introduction of the Euro in 1999.

India demonstrates quite some changes in proportion. The share of household expenditure has decreased significantly over the years while the share of gross capital formation has increased. This makes sense because India has developed a lot in the past years and it has been heavily invested in India. Unlike Germany, Net export are mostly below 0, which means that exports are lower than imports and there is a trade deficit.

The US also has a trade deficit, which has increased over the years. It is interesting to see that the share of Government expenditure has decreased in the US while the share of gross capital formation has overtaken the share of Government expenditure. 


### GDP Components

Since I am German, was born in the United States and grew up in Germany, I will compare these three countries in my next analysis, which investigates the different GDP components over time.

```{r}
# make a second country list
country_list_2 <- c("United States","Switzerland", "Germany")

# mutate into percentage
wide_GDP_calc_prop <- wide_GDP_calc %>%
  mutate(`Net exports` = `Net Exports` / GDP_calc,
         `Household Expenditure` = `Household expenditure` / GDP_calc,
         `Government Expenditure` = `Government expenditure` / GDP_calc,
         `Gross Capital Formation` = `Gross capital formation` / GDP_calc ) %>%
  select(Country, Year, "Net exports":"Gross Capital Formation")
wide_GDP_calc_prop
long_GDP_prop <- wide_GDP_calc_prop %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = c(`Net exports`:`Gross Capital Formation`),
                 names_to = "Component", 
                 values_to = "Proportion")
long_GDP_prop
tidy_GDP_data_prop_filter <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
    filter(Country %in% country_list_2, Components %in% indicator_list) 

# graph
countries_prop <- long_GDP_prop %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list_2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Proportion, color = Component)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Component)) +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  labs(title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Doller",
       y = "proportion", 
       x = "") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend("Components of GDP")) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1970, 2017, by = 10)) + # scale correctly

  expand_limits(y = 0) +
