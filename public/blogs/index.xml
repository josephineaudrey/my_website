      <description>datadrivencv  The goal of datadrivencv is to ease the burden of maintaining a CV by separating the content from the output by treating entries as data.
Installation The development version from GitHub with:
# install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;) devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;nstrayer/datadrivencv&amp;quot;)   Motivation Updating a CV is not fun Anytime I would go to add something to my CV I ended up wanting to change the format a tiny bit. This usually meant the entire word document completely falling apart and needing to have each entry copied and pasted into a new version.</description>
